# Blind-Assistive-System
This Blind Assistive System detects and classifies objects in real-time using a pre-trained MobileNet SSD model. It calculates object distances and provides auditory feedback via the pyttsx3 text-to-speech engine, describing objects and their proximity. This helps visually impaired users navigate safely by offering immediate, continuous assistance.
